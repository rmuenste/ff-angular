      Flow around a cylinder is a well-known benchmark for the evaluation of numerical algorithms for incompressible
      Navier-Stokes equations in the laminar case. It was developed in 1995 as part of the research project "Flow simulation on high-performance computers"
      funded by the German Research Association (DFG). In analogy to the 2D case a cuboid-shaped domain with a cylindrical obstacle is created and flow
      configurations for <app-mathjax [content]="'$Re = 20$'"></app-mathjax> and <app-mathjax [content]="'$Re = 100$'"></app-mathjax> are simulated. As observables for these simulations we choose the drag and lift coefficients on the cylinder.

      The benchmark problems are studied with the open-source software package OpenFOAM, the widely used commercial code ANSYS-CFX (CFX) and our in-house code FeatFloWer. For OpenFOAM (version 1.6)
      the icoFoam solver was used to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. For CFX (version 12.0 Service Pack 1) we used the transient Finite Volume solver to solve the fluid equations.

      Studying benchmark problem with these three different software packages which employ different numerical techniques also give an insight to answer of the following questions:
      <ul>
        <li>Can one construct an efficient solver for incompressible flow without employing multigrid components, at least for the pressure Poisson equation?</li>
        <li>What is the "best" strategy for time stepping: fully coupled iteration or operator splitting (pressure correction scheme)?</li>
        <li>Does it pay to use higher order discretization in space or time?</li>

     The Reynolds number is defined as Re=UD/ν where U is the mean velocity of the imposed parabolic profile on the inflow boundary and D is the diameter of the cylinder. The benchmark
     geometry and the corresponding 2D mesh at the coarsest level are shown in the figure below. The 3D mesh is obtained by extruding the 2D mesh in the z direction with 4 layers of cells,
     however the first level mesh for the computations is obtained by two successive refinements via connecting opposite midpoints of the the coarsest mesh which yields a mesh of 6144 cells.
     Our preliminary studies showed that this mesh offers a good balance between accuracy and computational cost.

     The software tools employ different numerical approaches to the discretization in space which leads to different numbers of degrees of freedom (DOF) for the same problem. In the case
     of OpenFOAM and CFX, the numbers of DOF are comparable while FeatFlow has a greater number of DOF for the same mesh due to a high order finite element approximation. Therefore, while
     comparing the results, reader should keep in mind that for the same computational mesh, FeatFlow has approximately as many DOF as the others have at one level finer grid. The number
     of DOF is always proportional to number of cells (equivalent to number of vertices for hexahedral meshes with large number of cells) in all CFD packages. The numbers of DOF are
     presented with respect to the number of cells of the corresponding mesh levels in the table below.
     <ul>
       <li>ndof = 3 · nvt for velocity and ndof = nvt for pressure in case of CFX</li>
       <li>ndof = 3 · nel for velocity and ndof = nel for pressure in case of OpenFOAM</li>
       <li>ndof = 24 · nvt for velocity and ndof = 4 · nel for pressure in case of FeatFlow</li>
     </ul>
     where ndof, nvt and nel denote the number of DOF, the number of vertices and the number of cells, respectively.

The first benchmark problem is at <app-mathjax [content]="'$Re=20$'"></app-mathjax> and has been studied numerically by many research groups, and very accurate results have been presented. The second benchmark problem is unsteady,
with a time-varying inflow profile which is very challenging and has not been rigorously studied, consequently the results have not yet been precisely determined. For the benchmark
problems, no-slip boundary condition is employed on the walls and natural do-nothing boundary conditions are imposed at the outflow plane. The inflow conditions are set with <app-mathjax [content]="'$U_m=0.45 m/s$'"></app-mathjax>
and <app-mathjax [content]="'$U_m=2.25 m/s$'"></app-mathjax> for the first and the second benchmark problem with the parabolic velocity profiles from the following two equations:
