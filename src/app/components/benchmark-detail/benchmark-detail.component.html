 The initial configuration, see the figure below, is identical for both test cases and
 consists of a circular bubble of radius <ng-katex [equation]="'r_0 = 0.25'"></ng-katex> centered at <ng-katex [equation]="'(x,y) = (0.5, 0.5)'"></ng-katex> in a
 1 by 2 rectangular domain. The density of the bubble is smaller than that of the
 surrounding fluid <ng-katex [equation]='(\\rho_1 \\lt \\rho_2)'></ng-katex>. The no-slip boundary condition (<ng-katex [equation]='\\mathbf{u}=0'></ng-katex>) is used at the top and
 bottom boundaries, whereas the free slip condition <ng-katex [equation]='\\left ( \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}} = 0, \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}
 \\cdot \\left ( \\nabla \\mathbf{u} + \\nabla \\mathbf{u}^T \\right ) \\right )'></ng-katex>, where <ng-katex [equation]='\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}'></ng-katex> is the
 tangent vector imposed on the vertical walls.

The table below lists the fluid and physical parameters which specify the test cases. The
evolution of the bubbles should be tracked for 3 time units during which the defined
benchmark quantities should be measured. The first test case models a rising bubble with Reynolds
number <ng-katex [equation]='Re=35'></ng-katex>, Eötvös number <ng-katex [equation]='Eo=10'></ng-katex>, and both density and viscosity ratios equal to 10.
The second and more challenging test case models a rising bubble with <ng-katex [equation]='Re=35'></ng-katex>, <ng-katex [equation]='Eo=125'></ng-katex>,
and with large density and viscosity ratios (1000 and 100).
