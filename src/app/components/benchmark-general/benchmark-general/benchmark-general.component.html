    We provide the computational details of a 3D multiphase flow benchmark problem which follows its already well-established 2D counterpart. The only introduced difference
    with respect to 2D benchmark case (aside of the additional spatial dimension) is the type of boundary condition applied at the side of the channel which according to the
    original 2D is attributed to free slip boundary condition, but in the 3D benchmark it is related to a no slip boundary condition.
