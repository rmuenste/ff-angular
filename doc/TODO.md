### ✅ Improve Test Output Readability with `karma-spec-reporter`

To make test results more readable and reduce noise in the console output, consider using the [`karma-spec-reporter`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/karma-spec-reporter). It provides a clean, focused summary of each test case, showing pass/fail status with your test labels.

#### 🛠 Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev karma-spec-reporter
```

#### ⚙️ Configuration

In `karma.conf.js`:

1. Add `'spec'` to the `reporters` array:

   ```js
   reporters: ['spec'];
   ```

2. Ensure the reporter is included in `plugins` (if using manual plugin setup):

   ```js
   plugins: [
     require('karma-spec-reporter'),
     // other plugins...
   ];
   ```

3. Optionally, disable default reporters like `'progress'` to avoid duplicate output:

   ```js
   reporters: ['spec'];
   ```

#### ✅ Benefits

* Clear, minimal test output (e.g., ✓ or ✗ per test)
* Your `it(...)` labels appear directly next to the result
* Easier to spot failed test names amidst noisy logs
