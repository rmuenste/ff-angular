## Project Overview

This is an Angular 13 project called "new-material" that appears to be a data visualization tool for scientific or engineering data. It uses Angular Material for UI components and `ngx-charts` and `plotly.js` for plotting.

## Backend

The project has two backends: a Node.js/Express server and a Python/FastAPI server. Both servers have the same functionality: serving static JSON data from the `server/data` directory. The Python server is the preferred backend, and the Node.js server should be deprecated.

## Frontend

The frontend is an Angular application with a large number of components. The core logic for fetching and processing data is located in `data.service.ts`. This service is very large and contains a lot of hardcoded data and repeated code for creating plots. This makes the service difficult to maintain and test.

Recent changes have started to address this issue by moving some of the hardcoded data to separate files in a new `src/app/data` directory. This is a positive change, but more refactoring is needed.

## Data

The application uses a large number of static JSON and text files as data sources. These files are located in the `server/data` and `src` directories. The data seems to be related to fluid dynamics simulations, with filenames like `c1g1l1_circularity.json` and `ff_bubbleMassL1.json`.

## Current Issues

*   **Large, Monolithic Service:** The `data.service.ts` is still very large and contains a lot of repeated code for creating plots.
*   **Hardcoded Data:** While some data has been moved, the service still imports a large amount of static data directly from files.
*   **Lack of Tests:** The project still lacks meaningful tests.
*   **Redundant Backends:** The Node.js and Python backends are still both present.

## Recommendations

*   **Deprecate the Node.js backend:** Remove the Node.js backend and update the frontend to use the Python backend exclusively.
*   **Refactor the `data.service.ts`:** Continue refactoring the service by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable services. Use a configuration file to specify the data files to be loaded, rather than hardcoding them in the service.
*   **Add tests:** Add unit tests for the services and components. This will make it easier to refactor the code and prevent bugs.
*   **Use a data management solution:** For a production application, it would be better to use a database or other data management solution to store the data, rather than relying on static files.
